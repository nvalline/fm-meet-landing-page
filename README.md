## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned more about using HTML's 'picture' element, the CSS unit 'vw', and also using the ::before psuedo-selector. I have not used either very much in previous projects.

### Continued development

I am enjoying learning new aspects that continue to expand my frontend skills.

[Jasoneczek's](https://github.com/jasoneczek/fementor-meet-landing-page/blob/main/assets/css/style.css) solution to this challenge helped me understand implementing 'vw' and '::before' to successfully achieve my desired results.
